# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
This is a description of the repo created for "Getting and Cleaning Data" course project. The goal of the project is to read in a data set and produce a clean data out of it.  

## Files in this Repo
* README.md:         This file.
* CodeBook.md:       Describes the variables in the output data and working of the script.
* run_analysis.R:    The script that performs all steps required to produce clean data.  

## Running the script
The script should be copied into the directory where data set is present and run from there. It will produce tidydata2.txt in the same directory.
